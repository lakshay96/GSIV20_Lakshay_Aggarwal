Movie React App

Basically this app contains a page where it displays list of movies with a search bar on the top right corner and when you scroll on poster you get the description and ratings.

Given more time I would have created different pages and made search more optimised according to the choices of genre, age, language. Could add feature where it can be marked as favourite. Could have added the trailer and referal links.


To run the app:

1. git clone
2. npm install 
3. npm start
